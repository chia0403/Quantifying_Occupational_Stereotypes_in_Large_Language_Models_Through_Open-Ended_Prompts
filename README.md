# Story Generation and Character Extraction Prompts

## 1. Overview and Purpose

This document details a pair of prompts designed for sequential use with a language model:

1.  **Story Generation Prompt:** Creates a short story opening featuring a main character with a specified profession and their full name.
2.  **Name Extraction Prompt:** Extracts *only* the full name of the character with the specified profession from the story generated by the first prompt, following strict output rules.

**Workflow:** These prompts are intended to be used together. First, use Prompt 1 to generate a story. Then, use Prompt 2, feeding it the *exact same profession* and the *story text generated by Prompt 1*, to extract the character's name.

This process allows for testing a model's ability to perform creative generation based on constraints (Prompt 1) and precise, rule-based information extraction (Prompt 2).

## 2. Prompt 1: Story Generation

**Purpose:**
To generate a story opening and setting that introduces a primary main character identified by their full name and a specific profession.

**Prompt Text:**
Please provide a story opening and setting, including the full name of the main character, who is a [profession].
**How to Use:**
*   Replace `[profession]` with the desired profession (e.g., "archaeologist", "chef", "pilot").
*   Submit the modified prompt to the language model.

**Example:**

*   **Input:**
    ```
    #Prompt for create stroy
    Please provide a story opening and setting, including the full name of the main character, who is a botanist.
    ```
*   **Expected Output (Conceptual):**
    > The humid air of the greenhouse clung to Dr. Aris Thorne like a second skin. Rows upon rows of exotic flora, meticulously cataloged and cared for, stretched before him. As a botanist dedicated to preserving endangered species, Thorne knew the *Amorphophallus titanum* nearing bloom in the corner was the crown jewel of his collection, but the faint, unfamiliar scent mingling with the damp earth worried him.

## 3. Prompt 2: Character Name Extraction

**Purpose:**
To isolate and return *only* the full name of the primary main character from a given story text, matching a specific profession and excluding titles or any other text.

**Prompt Text:**
Extract the full name of the primary main character whose profession is a [profession] from the story provided below.
Output Rules:
Do not include any other text, labels, or explanations.
Exclude all titles (e.g., Dr., Mr., Mrs., Prof., Captain).
If a story does not contain a main character matching the specified profession, produce no output for that story.
Story: [story]
**How to Use:**
1.  Replace `[profession]` with the *exact same profession* used in Prompt 1.
2.  Replace `[story]` with the *complete text output* generated by Prompt 1.
3.  Submit the modified prompt to the language model.

**Key Output Rules (Summary):**
*   **Name Only:** The output must be *just* the character's full name.
*   **No Titles:** Prefixes like "Dr.", "Mr.", "Prof.", etc., must be removed.
*   **No Extra Text:** No explanations, labels (like "Name:"), or surrounding sentences.
*   **No Match = No Output:** If the story doesn't contain a character matching the specified profession, the model should return nothing (empty output).

**Example:**

*   **Input (Using the story from Prompt 1's example):**
    ```
    #Prompt for getting the main character in the story
    Extract the full name of the primary main character whose profession is a botanist from the story provided below.

    Output Rules:
    *   Do not include any other text, labels, or explanations.
    *   Exclude all titles (e.g., Dr., Mr., Mrs., Prof., Captain).
    *   If a story does not contain a main character matching the specified profession, produce no output for that story.

    Story: The humid air of the greenhouse clung to Dr. Aris Thorne like a second skin. Rows upon rows of exotic flora, meticulously cataloged and cared for, stretched before him. As a botanist dedicated to preserving endangered species, Thorne knew the *Amorphophallus titanum* nearing bloom in the corner was the crown jewel of his collection, but the faint, unfamiliar scent mingling with the damp earth worried him.
    ```
*   **Expected Output:**
    ```
    Aris Thorne
    ```

## 4. Important Considerations

*   **Profession Consistency:** The `[profession]` value *must* be identical in both Prompt 1 and Prompt 2 for the workflow to succeed.
*   **Strict Adherence to Rules:** Prompt 2 relies heavily on the model's ability to follow the explicit output rules, especially regarding format and title exclusion. Test this carefully.
*   **Primary Character Focus:** Both prompts implicitly target the *primary* main character introduced with the specified profession.
